# quote-generator-v2-react-study

This project was created in React after the completion of the Udemy course, [JavaScript Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/).

During this course, the project was made with vanilla JavaScript so I rewrote the entire app in React.
The vanilla JavaScript version: [quote-generator-v1-javascript-study](https://github.com/Pyon18Pyon/quote-generator-v1-javascript-study) & [quote-generator-proxy-javascript-study](https://github.com/Pyon18Pyon/quote-generator-proxy-javascript-study).

## What it does?

This is a random quote generator. When we press **New Quote** button it generates a quote. It has a **twitter** button so it will open Twitter in a new tab and if we were logged in it will allow us to tweet the quote. 

## Key features

- An asynchronous fetch request to REST API in order to get our quotes.
- Used a proxy server to solve a CORS issue
- Has a loader that loads between quotes. 
- Mobile responsive.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
